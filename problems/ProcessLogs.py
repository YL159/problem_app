'''
A single threaded CPU processing a series of processes/tasks with 0-indexed PIDs. While some task is occupying the CPU,
another task may cut in line because of higher priority, and the current task is pre-empted until that task is done, and thus
resume its CPU time.
Given the total number of tasks n, and a list of CPU logs with format "pid(int):start/stop:time(int)", calculate the respective
total CPU time of each process in the order of increasing PID.
