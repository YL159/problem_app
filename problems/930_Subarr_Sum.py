'''
930. Binary Subarrays With Sum
Find count of all subarrays sum to goal
subset of problem 560 https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/
pfs is workable here as well

Here is another O(n) time approach
With enhanced moving frame (sliding window), check each tight 1...1 subarray's neighboring options and add to result.
Since each of these subarray has different 1...1 core, uniqueness guaranteed.

Treat goal = 0 differently, because 0 plus itself is still 0, the goal.
Unlike 1 plus itself will deviate from goal.
